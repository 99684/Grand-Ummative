# .devcontainer

The .devcontainer file folder is NOT game related! It does not matter and is not required for game functionality. It is only required for game testers using Codespaces so that there are no driver errors when a tester attempts to test the game ON CODESPACE ONLY!
Despite this warning, developers should NOT remove the .devcontainer folders! They are required for the docker environment to work properly!
